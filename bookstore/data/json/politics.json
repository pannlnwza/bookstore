If libertarians are correct, the law should intrude into people's lives as little as possible, rarely telling them what to do or how to live.A political and economic philosophy as old as John Locke and John Stuart Mill, but as alive and timely as Rand Paul, the Tea Party, and the novels of Ayn Rand, libertarianism emphasizes individual rights and calls for a radical reduction in the power and size of government. \"Libertarianism For Beginners\" lays out the history and principles of this often-misunderstood philosophy in lucid, dispassionate terms that help illuminate today's political dialogue.\"",

Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwater\u2019s worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The radicalism of today\u2019s conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the Republican Party\u2014it beat back alternative definitions of conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administration\u2014not Nixon not Reagan not two Bushes\u2014could live up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W. Bush, to Newt Gingrich\u2019s revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d and a \u201cFourth Way\u201d to Clinton\u2019s \u201cThird Way.\u201d Conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of \u201cbig government\u201d and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education, and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party, controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the country\u2019s, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how.",

The rich are getting richer by rigging the system in their favor, leaving the rest of us to struggle just to keep our heads above water. To save the American Dream, we\u2019re told that we need to fight inequality through tax hikes, wealth redistribution schemes, and a far higher minimum wage.But what if that narrative is wrong? What if the real threat to the American Dream isn\u2019t rising income inequality\u2014but an all-out war on success?In Equal is Unfair, a timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything we\u2019ve been taught about inequality is wrong. You\u2019ll discover:\u2022 why successful CEOs make so much money\u2014and deserve to\u2022 how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help\u2022 why middle-class stagnation is a myth\u2022 how the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced equality\u2022 the disturbing philosophy behind Obama\u2019s economic agenda.The critics of inequality are right about one thing: the American Dream is under attack. But instead of fighting to make America a place where anyone can achieve success, they are fighting to tear down those who already have. The real key to making America a freer, fairer, more prosperous nation is to protect and celebrate the pursuit of success\u2014not pull down the high fliers in the name of equality.",
