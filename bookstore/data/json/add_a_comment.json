They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in I Andrea Harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending Duke Law School when her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father, Nicholas, and uncle, Michael, in a surprising and puzzling attack. They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her father\u2019s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth\u2019s own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea\u2019s attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her father\u2019s home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholas\u2019s on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholas\u2019s at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don\u2019s wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea\u2019s father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea\u2019s closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason\u2019s death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Beth\u2019s old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governor\u2019s seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come\u2014the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor\u2019s seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michael\u2019s whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her father\u2019s new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end.",

T Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the\u00a0pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation\u2019s sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get\u00a0into and out of relationships, all with the hope\u00a0of finding someone with whom we share a deep\u00a0connection. This seems standard now, but it\u2019s\u00a0wildly different from what people did even just\u00a0decades ago. Single people today have more\u00a0romantic options than at any point in human\u00a0history. With technology, our abilities to connect\u00a0with and sort through these options are staggering.\u00a0So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.\u00a0\u201cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\u201d\u00a0\u201cShould I go out with this girl even though she\u00a0listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?\u00a0Combos?!\u201d \u201cMy girlfriend just got a message from\u00a0some dude named Nathan. Who\u2019s Nathan? Did he\u00a0just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check\u00a0just to be sure?\u201d\u00a0But the transformation of our romantic lives\u00a0can\u2019t be explained by technology alone. In a short\u00a0period of time, the whole culture of finding love\u00a0has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,\u00a0people would find a decent person who lived in\u00a0their neighborhood. Their families would meet\u00a0and, after deciding neither party seemed like a\u00a0murderer, they would get married and soon have\u00a0a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,\u00a0people marry later than ever and spend years of\u00a0their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a\u00a0soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his\u00a0comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern\u00a0Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take\u00a0things to another level. He teamed up with NYU\u00a0sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive\u00a0research project, including hundreds of interviews\u00a0and focus groups conducted everywhere from\u00a0Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed\u00a0behavioral data and surveys and created their own\u00a0online research forum on Reddit, which drew\u00a0thousands of messages. They enlisted the world\u2019s\u00a0leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen\u00a0Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry\u00a0Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any\u00a0social science or humor book we\u2019ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his\u00a0irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science\u00a0to give us an unforgettable tour of our new\u00a0romantic world.",
