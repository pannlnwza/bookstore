Looking for answers to today\u2019s wrenching challenges, William Martin turns to the Tao Te Ching and finds that while Taoism is known for its quiet, enigmatic wisdom, the Tao can also have the cleansing force of a rushing river.Through his interpretation of this ancient Chinese text, Martin elucidates revolutionary messages condemning power-seeking and greed. He emphasizes that humans have a \u201cnatural virtue\u201d that can help them heal the planet; shows how Taoism\u2019s simplicity can be subversive and its flexibility a potent force; and reassures that \u201cwhen injustice is the rule, justice always lies in wait.\u201dProvocative and stirring, Martin\u2019s Tao flows within and through those who ride the waves of anger and frustration and gently guides them to true freedom.\u201cWe have learned the secret of transformation: Injustice feeds our determination. Hate increases our love. Wounds bring forth our healing, and fear uncovers our courage and serenity.\u201d\u2014 from The Activist\u2019s Tao Te Ching",

They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, \u201cIf I gave you God\u2019s phone number, what would you do with it?\u201d This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you God\u2019s phone number\u2026 offers the reader what only the best books offer\u2014windows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwell\u2019s conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range.

It is distinguished by Ms. Cromwell's empathy for the interesting and diverse people she searched out to interview about their communication with God. Readers will be stimulated to reflect on their own spiritual journey as well as the author's own experiences and those of the people she has interviewed. Because of Ms. Cromwell's personal candor and insights, I continue to ponder the central question she asked her interviewees in this important and unusual book.\" \u2013James Crowfoot, Ph.D., Professor and Dean Emeritus, University of Michigan and former President of Antioch College\u201cMare Cromwell has done a wonderful job of bringing people's personal views on God and spirituality to the public in this book. These stories will deepen our understanding of the diversity of spirituality in the human experience.\u201d\u2013Garrett Sarley, President of the Omega Institute, author of \"The Essentials of Yoga\" and \"Walking Yoga\"ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Mare Cromwell is an author, poet, gardener and environmentalist.

These are the questions that flood our hearts and minds when the unimaginable happens. When things go horribly wrong and the world seems to be unraveling, how do you believe in God s goodness? How do you cling to hope? Chad Veach directs readers away from cliched Sunday school answers that fail to offer real comfort or provide faith-building insights. Instead, he draws from God s promises in the Bible and from the story of his own daughter s diagnosis of a devastating and debilitating disease to reveal simple, purposeful steps for dealing with pain. Resting in God s love, remembering his past faithfulness, and realizing the distinction between having faith and clinging to hope are just some of these steps. Veach reminds us that because we know who God is, we know there is hope.\"",
