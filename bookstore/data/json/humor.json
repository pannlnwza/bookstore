Even if you sometimes think you aren\u2019t! And especially if other people try to tell you you\u2019re not.In I Know What I\u2019m Doing\u2014and Other Lies I Tell Myself, Jen offers up all the gory details of a life permanently in progress. She reassures you that it\u2019s okay to not have life completely figured out, even when you reach middle age (and find your first gray pubic hair!). She talks about making unusual or unpopular life decisions (such as cultivating a \u201cfriend with benefits\u201d or not going home for the holidays) because you don\u2019t necessarily want for yourself what everyone else seems to think you should. It\u2019s about renting when everyone says you should own, dating around when everyone thinks you should settle down, and traveling alone when everyone pities you for going to Paris without a man.From marriage to divorce and sex to mental health, I Know What I\u2019m Doing\u2014and Other Lies I Tell Myself is about embracing the fact that life is a bit of a sh*t show and it\u2019s definitely more than okay to stay true to yourself.",
