No other writ Anti-apartheid activist, Bollywood screenwriter, Nazi pin-up, hero of the Wild West: this is Shakespeare as you have never seen him before.From the sixteenth-century Baltic to the American Revolution, from colonial India to the skyscrapers of modern-day Shanghai, Shakespeare\u2019s plays appear at the most fascinating of times and in the most unexpected of places. No other writer\u2019s work has been performed, translated, adapted and altered in such a remarkable variety of cultures and languages. But what is it about William Shakespeare \u2013 a man from Warwickshire who never once set foot outside England \u2013 that has made him at home in so many places around the globe?Travelling across four continents, six countries and 400 years, Andrew Dickson takes us on a personal journey rich in insight and surprise. We enter the air-conditioned vault deep beneath Capitol Hill where the world\u2019s largest collection of First Folios is stored; discover the shadowy history of Joseph Goebbels\u2019s obsession with Shakespeare; and uncover the true story behind the scuffed edition in which Nelson Mandela and fellow Robben Island prisoners inscribed their names. Both cultural history and literary travelogue, Worlds Elsewhere is an attempt to understand how Shakespeare has become the international phenomenon he is \u2013 and why.\"There were very few pages on which I didn\u2019t learn something new or revelatory. A must-read for anyone interested in Shakespeare\u2019s impact on people and politics around the globe\" (James Shapiro, author of 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare)\"Immensely well-informed and highly readable. A revelatory journey of cultural exploration\" (Professor Stanley Wells, General Editor of the Oxford and Penguin Shakespeares)\"Brilliantly original. Absolutely engaging, witty and irresistible. What\u2019s most remarkable: he\u2019s said something new about Shakespeare\" (Michael Pye, author of The Edge of the World)\"A truly original book about Shakespeare: one that explores the dramatist's global reach with tenacity, devotion and an exhilarating spirit of adventure\" (Michael Billington)",

This project turned into a quest to discover the secrets of the neighborhood\u2019s flora and fauna, and yielded more than names and trivia: Johnson developed a relationship with his nonhuman neighbors.Johnson argues that learning to see the world afresh, like a child, shifts the way we think about nature: Instead of something distant and abstract, nature becomes real\u2014all at once comical, annoying, and beautiful. This shift can add tremendous value to our lives, and it might just be the first step in saving the world.No matter where we live\u2014city, country, oceanside, ormountains\u2014there are wonders that we walk past every day. Unseen City widens the pinhole of our perspective by allowing us to view the world from the high-altitude eyes of a turkey vulture and the distinctly low-altitude eyes of a snail. The narrative allows us to eavesdrop on the comically frenetic life of a squirrel and peer deep into the past with a ginkgo biloba tree. Each of these organisms has something unique to tell us about our neighborhoods and, chapter by chapter, Unseen City takes us on a journey that is part nature lesson and part love letter to the world\u2019s urban jungles. With the right perspective, a walk to the subway can be every bit as entrancing as a walk through a national park.",

Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all.\u00a0Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age.",
